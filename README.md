My first portfolio with incubator hub for Data Analysis

I have learnt a number of things, from excel to sql and also portfolio building

## Project Topic: Degradation of F1 wheels
### Project Overview
This project aims to give insight to the tyre degradation over the different laps in a Grand Prix. This project would help to analyse, using statistical tools, the lap-by-lap degradation of a carâ€™s tires during a Grand Prix, based on telemetry data segmented by track sectors and collected for each lap. Using the available data, tire wear will be measured and analyzed. The focus of the analysis is on applying hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and linear regression to interpret tire behavior over time and to identify statistically significant relationships between variables. The goal is to describe the phenomenon from a statistical perspective and support the technical evaluation with quantitative evidence.
